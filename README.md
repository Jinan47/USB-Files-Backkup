# File Organizer Python Script

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)

## Description

The USB Files Backup & Organization Python Script is a simple yet powerful tool that automates the process of copying files from an external device, such as a USB drive or an external hard disk, to a designated file destination on your computer. This script not only copies the files but also organizes them into specific folders based on their file types, making it easier to manage and find your files.

## Features

- Copy files from an external device to a specified destination folder.
- Organize files into folders based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, videos).
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Option to exclude certain file types from being copied and organized.
- Handles duplicate files with intelligent naming strategies.

## How It Works

1. Connect your external device (e.g., USB drive) to your computer.
2. Run the script using the command line: `backup.py`.
3. The script will prompt you to provide the source directory (path to the connected device) and the destination directory (where you want to copy and organize the files).
4. The script will then scan the source directory, copy files to the destination folder, and organize them into subfolders based on their types.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Jinan47/USB-Files-Backup.git

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

## Usage

1. Connect your external device (USB drive, external hard disk, etc.) to your computer.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the script:
   ```
   backup.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the source directory, destination directory, and any file types to exclude.

5. Sit back and let the script organize your files!
